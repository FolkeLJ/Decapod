            <p>Born and raised on the Norwegian island Karmøy, Jan Roar has always been close to the sea. Ever since childhood he took a particular interest for crabs. After spending the early days of his education and career as a mechanic, Jan Roar started designing and devloping machinery for the industrial production of crab - something he has now been doing for 33 years. Jan Roar is the inventor of all of MS-Solutions’ crab handling technologies and is thereby the most essential member of our team. .</p>
